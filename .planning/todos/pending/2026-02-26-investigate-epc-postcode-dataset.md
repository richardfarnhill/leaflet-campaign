## Description
EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) data grouped by postcode - could provide property/tenure insights.

## Investigation Needed
- [ ] What data does this contain? (property types, energy ratings, tenure?)
- [ ] What's the granularity? (postcode sector, full postcode?)
- [ ] Is it free to use?
- [ ] Could it supplement or replace NOMIS for demographic data?
- [ ] Useful for route planning (filtering by property type/tenure)?
- [ ] How to integrate? (download CSV, API, bulk?)

## Relationship to Current Work
- Could provide alternative/complementary data to NOMIS for owner_occupied_pct
- Might help with "building an image of who our clients are"
- Property type data could help target specific areas

## Suggested Phase
Add to Phase 10 or Phase 11 (future planning) after investigation complete.
