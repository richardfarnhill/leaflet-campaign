## Description
Potentially helpful for improving postcode mapping/lookup functionality.

## Investigation Needed
- [ ] What does this space do? (postcode lookup, geocoding, mapping?)
- [ ] Is it free to use?
- [ ] Does it offer features beyond postcodes.io? (better accuracy, more data?)
- [ ] Can it help with OA (Output Area) lookups?
- [ ] What's the API/story for integration?

## Notes
Found during Phase 9 planning - may help with mapping improvements in future phases.

## Suggested Phase
Add to Phase 11 or Phase 12 (future planning) after investigation complete.
