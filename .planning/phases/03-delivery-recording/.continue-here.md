<current_state>
Phase 3 not yet formally planned via GSD. Code changes for Phase 3 scope are committed and pushed to `feature/card-based-reservation-system`. One Supabase SQL step is outstanding before the Unassign button works. No end-to-end testing done yet.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 1 (Database Foundation): ✅ All tables, RPCs, seed data — done manually, SUMMARY.md written
- Phase 2 (Territory & Reservation): ✅ Full UI, modals, bug fixes — done manually, SUMMARY.md written
- Phase 3 UI prep committed:
  - Hide completed area cards from grid
  - Add Unassign button (red) + modal on reserved cards
  - Fix complete_delivery soft-success bug (delivery:null treated as success)
  - Add CSS .area-card-btn.unassign
- .planning/ structure tidied to proper GSD layout (phase dirs, SUMMARY.md files, stray files moved)
- STATE.md reformatted to GSD template (under 100 lines)
- Debug files deleted, added to .gitignore
- All changes committed and pushed

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Task 1: ✅ Run unassign_area SQL in Supabase SQL editor — DONE
- Task 2: ✅ End-to-end test at localhost:3000:
  - Reserve an available area → card turns reserved ✓
  - Unassign → card returns to available ✓
  - Reassign → card stays reserved with new name ✓
  - Complete → NOT TESTED (user didn't want area to disappear)
- Task 3: Decide if sumDelivered stat should pull from deliveries table or stay as session_log only
- Task 4: ✅ Allow optional second team member assignment on areas — DONE
  - Reserve Modal: Added optional second team member dropdown
  - Card display: Shows both team members (e.g. "John & Jane")
  - Reassign Modal: Shows both current members, allows reassigning either
  - reserve_area RPC: Updated to accept team_member_2_id
  - reassign_area RPC: Updated to handle team_member_2

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- No user roles — anyone can reserve, complete, reassign, or unassign any area
- Completed cards hidden from grid entirely
- Unassign = red button, no confirmation of who to reassign to — just releases back to available
- Single-file app (index.html) — no build system, keeping it that way
- GSD .planning structure: use OpenCode-compatible layout (phase dirs with PLAN/SUMMARY/continue-here)
- STATE.md must follow GSD template strictly — digest only, under 100 lines, pointer to PROJECT.md
- This project runs GSD under OpenCode (not Claude Code) — Claude Code sessions should read .opencode/ and .planning/ before acting

</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- Task 1: ✅ unassign_area RPC - DONE
- Task 4: ✅ reserve_area RPC - DONE (updated to accept team_member_2_id)
- Task 4b: ✅ reassign_area RPC - DONE (updated to handle team_member_2)

</blockers>

<context>
Single-file vanilla JS app (index.html) talking directly to Supabase REST API. No framework, no build step. All modal patterns: open function sets currentXxxAreaId → modal shows → confirm calls sbFetch to RPC → on success calls loadAreaCards() then renderAreaCards(). The reservations table tracks active/cancelled separately from target_areas.status — RPCs update both atomically. Supports optional dual team member assignment.

<next_action>
Phase 3 remaining: decide on sumDelivered data source, then transition to next phase or test complete flow.
