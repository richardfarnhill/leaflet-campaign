# Roadmap: Leaflet Campaign Tracker

**Project:** Card-Based Reservation System  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Depth:** Standard (6 phases)

---

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a complete card-based reservation system for leaflet delivery teams. The system enables teams to reserve geographic areas (800-1200 doors), record deliveries, track enquiries/cases, and visualize campaign analytics with heatmaps. Development flows from database foundation through core reservation mechanics to analytics and integrations.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Database Foundation

**Goal:** Supabase schema with RLS and PostGIS operational

**Requirements:** (Implicit foundation for all subsequent phases)

- PostGIS extension enabled for spatial queries

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Data Migration Required**
- Existing data from session_log, finance_actuals, rescheduled_sessions MUST be preserved
- Migrate existing deliveries to new schema structure
- Migrate existing enquiries/cases to new schema
- Keep old tables as backup until migration verified

**Success Criteria (5):**
1. Developer can create new campaign via database or UI with name, start_date, end_date, target_leaflets
2. Developer can create team members with name, role, contact details
3. All database tables have RLS policies enforced - authenticated users can only see assigned campaign data
4. PostGIS extension is enabled and spatial queries work (distance calculations, bounding boxes)
5. **Existing delivery data migrated** - All yesterday's deliveries preserved in new schema

---

### Phase 2: Territory & Reservation

**Goal:** Teams can claim geographic chunks (800-1200 doors) with date selection

**Requirements:**

---

### Phase 3: Delivery Recording

**Goal:** Teams can record delivery completions with accurate leaflet counts

**Requirements:** (Implicit - delivery recording enables completion tracking)
- Delivery completion workflow

- Auto-update area status on completion

**Dependencies:** Phase 2 (requires reservation workflow)

**Success Criteria (4):**
1. Team member can mark a reserved area as completed with actual leaflet count delivered

**Goal:** Robust enquiry recording with client details and team progress tracking

**Requirements:**
- ENQ-01: Robust Enquiry Recording

### Bug Fix Session (2026-02-26) — post-Phase 9

Multiple UI bugs fixed and improvements made outside the phase plan:

**Bug fixes:**
- Delivery journal `id` missing from SELECT → `openEditDelivery('undefined')` crash
- Delivery journal: added Delete button per row
- Financial projections never rendered (`updateFinance` was dead code — fixed call chain)
- Revenue attribution used non-existent `target_areas.team_member_1_id` — fixed to use deliveries
- Team revenue showed `£1,000%` (double-suffix bug) — fixed
- Postcode not saved to `demographic_feedback` on enquiry insert — fixed
- NOMIS enrichment silently failing: `order=created_at.desc` should be `recorded_at` — fixed
- Missing RLS UPDATE policy on `demographic_feedback` — added

**UI improvements:**
- All Campaigns mode: Delivery journal shows Campaign column as first column
- All Campaigns mode: Enquiries list now visible (was hidden); Campaign column; read-only (no Edit/Delete)
- All Campaigns mode: Finance projections hidden; replaced by 4 summary cards (total leaflets, enquiries, conversion rate, avg response rate)
- All Campaigns mode: Campaign Breakdown replaced HTML table with `.finance-metric-card` grid with mini progress bars
- All Campaigns mode: Sessions Done / progress % now correctly filters to active campaigns only
- Finance projections: `updateSummary()` stub replaced with `loadSummaryStats()` — projections now re-render after enquiry save/delete
- Finance: Avg case value card shows actual (revenue ÷ cases) when real data exists; configured estimate shown as fallback with `*`
- Banner: "Est. Completion" (always `—`) replaced with "This Month" — leaflets delivered in current calendar month
- Campaign config modal: Archive (amber) and Delete (red) buttons — archive sets `is_active=false`, delete cascades all child data
- Enquiries section: split into two separate tables — "Enquiries" (non-instructed, no Value column) and "Instructions" (instructed, green header, Value column bold, grand total row)

*Last updated: 2026-02-26 — Phase 9 complete, all bugs fixed, UI improved.*
