# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Teams can reserve geographic delivery areas (cards), record deliveries, and the system accurately tracks coverage, enquiries, and cases per area.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 - Analytics & Heatmaps

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 7 (Analytics & Heatmaps)
Plan: 1 ready in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-02-25 — Phase 4 planned with CONTEXT.md and 04-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] ~14%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0 (work done manually outside GSD)
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: —

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Phase 2]: No user roles — anyone can reserve, complete, or reassign any area
- [Phase 2]: Completed cards hidden from grid — only available/reserved shown
- [Phase 3]: Optional dual team member assignment — can assign 1 or 2 team members per area
- [Phase 3]: Cards display both team members (e.g. "John & Jane")
- [All]: Single-file app (index.html) — no build system, keep it that way for now

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
