# Project Instructions for Claude

## Multi-Agent Coordination

This project is worked on concurrently by Claude and OpenCode.

**At the start of every session where you will make code changes:**

1. Read `.planning/COORDINATION.md` — this is the protocol
2. Read `.planning/STATE.md` → `## Active Tasks` — check for existing claims
3. Add your claim before touching any files:
   `- Claude [scope] — [brief description] — claimed [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC]`
4. Remove your claim from STATE.md when your work is committed

If OpenCode has an active claim that overlaps your intended work, stop and tell the user.

## Project Context

Read `.planning/STATE.md` first in every session for current position, decisions, and blockers.
