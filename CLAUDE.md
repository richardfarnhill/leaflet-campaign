# Project Instructions for Claude

## Multi-Agent Coordination

This project is worked on concurrently by Claude and OpenCode.

**At the start of every session:**

1. Read `.planning/COORDINATION.md` — full protocol lives here
2. Read `.planning/STATE.md` — current position, decisions, blockers
3. Check `## Active Tasks` in STATE.md — if OpenCode has claimed your intended work, stop and tell the user
4. Find unclaimed work: plans without SUMMARY.md, `.continue-here.md`, or ad-hoc tasks
5. Claim your work before touching any files:
   `- Claude [scope] — [brief description] — claimed [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC]`
6. Remove your claim from STATE.md when your work is committed

## Project Context

Read `.planning/STATE.md` first in every session for current position, decisions, and blockers.
